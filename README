This program takes a log file, parses out IP addresses and determines the forecasted high-temperature for the next
calendar day.  This temperature data is then partitioned into histogram bins of user-provided width, whereupon the min,
max, and count values are tabulated into a TSV.

Requires installing numpy and requests,

Usage is:
python AD_Coding_Exercise.py <input file> <output file> <bucket count>
